# Requirements:
1. SDL2 (v2.0.10)
2. SDL Library - SDL_ttf (v2.0.18)
3. VS Code/ CodeBlock/

# Downloads: 
1. SDL2 ([SDL2-2.0.10](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.0.10))
2. SDL_ttf ([SDL_ttf-2.0.18](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases/tag/release-2.0.18))
3. Code Block ([codeblock download ](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/)) OR use VSCode

### Note: For easy setup: Download `codeblocks-20.0x-mingw` which include `mingw`compiler then download `devel-2.0.10-mingw.tar.gz` release of SDL2 and SDL_ttf.


# Setup
1. SDL2
 ⁂ Download and extract SDL folder (you may need to extract two times cuz, file is zipped as `tar` then `gz`) then rename `SDL2-2.0.10` to simple name like `SDL2` then copy to `C:\` Drive. `Path` must 
    look like this

 ⁂ After Copying, go to `i686-w64-mingw32` folder if you have 64-bit windows, or `x86_64-w64-mingw32` if 32-bit machine. then go to `bin` directory then copy `SDL2.dll`.
    then Paste `SDL2.dll` to `C:\Windows\System` ( for 64 bit) OR `C:\Windows\System32` (for 32 bit)

2. Do similar steps for SDL_ttf

3. CodeBlock
   ⁂ If you don't want to setup CodeBLock, Download this whole project as zip, then run CodeBlock probject (.cbp)  file `dsa_sorting.cbp`.
